            <h2>North America</h2>
            <p>I personally dont watch or know to much about North American Soccer. But that doesnt take away from
               the
               fact that the top leagues do go on to produce above average players that often get sent overseas to
               european soccer clubs. The Leagues most people are interested in are Major League Soccer, Mexican Liga
               BBVA MX, and Canadian Premier League.</p>

            <h2>South America</h2>
            <p>Producing players like Lionel Messi, Neymar, and Luis Suarez its no wonder why people like this region
               when it comes to soccer. Some of the most know leagues from South America are Argentine Liga
               Profesional
               de FÃºtbol which has teams such as River Plate and Boca Juniors,and Brazilian Serie A, with teams like
               Santos and Flamengo. Global Success isnt out of the picture for South America with Argentina Claiming
               2nd
               in the previous World Cup.</p>
